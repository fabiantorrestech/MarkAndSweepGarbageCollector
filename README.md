# MarkAndSweepGarbageCollector
Mark and Sweep Garbage Collector (C) - CS 361

Live Demo: https://replit.com/@fabiantorrestec/MarkAndSweepGarbageCollector

This "Mark and Sweep" algorithm garbage collector will run a series of tests through this file to ensure that the garbage collection works correctly. The garbage collector operates by freeing memory from the heap.

It must run in a Linux environment for this work, as it utilizes Linux System calls.
